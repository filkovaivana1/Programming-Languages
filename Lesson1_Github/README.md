"# Github basics" 

First, we need to create an github account
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65a04c08-46c3-479f-89eb-8dc26b5a238b)

We do that by entering email, password and username:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840b1948-2541-48c3-8150-caa154b24db9)

After that we are required to verify our account by entering code sent on email. After finishing verification we login to our account:

After successful login we choose create repository
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40ee36d-c0ee-4acc-8d00-42728d4df650)

On creating the repository we choose the repostory name:

After creating new reposotory we get full info

Next, we use command prompt in order to create and upload md file on our repository
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37eea709-e79a-41ff-a2f1-a4811c0464e1)

We set our current working directory to be where we want our md file to be created 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb66298-ca2a-4f3b-a143-8c738004cc74)

Than we create the md file:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85150cb9-6278-4180-b89b-3d4a7da202a3)

After that, we initialize empty git repository locally
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3695f28-d00e-4263-ab91-ff6637c2243f)

Now, we can work everything we want inside the folder in which we initialized our empty repository
And we add our md file in the local git repository
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/743f981c-a336-4520-ba3e-637955c3045a)

And after we finish working we add everything else in our empty git repository 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/011d44f3-0eb9-49b8-b3e6-65b9be5ae720)

After adding everything we worked inside our local repository, we simply commit everything done
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20943bac-49db-4270-accf-dfbaadab3c99)

After commiting we add main branch
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16466bcf-b983-4e97-8c4d-72f5b4c90c34)

And set the remote origin to be the remote repository, which means everything we push will go there 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a613e9c-8f6c-473a-bb36-ef946cb274f1)

Next, we push everything we worked and commited on the remote repository
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7c611de-5527-4f0a-83f0-f0d3b072c75f)


But pushing for the frist time will require some preauthorization: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55ad39c6-239f-49a6-8f86-7fc768d21b86)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2d5b8b4-ead3-4a40-8711-6b3502fcd9be)

After successful preauthorization we can continue pushing our changes and if everything as needed we will get response message that pushing code is done 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a6afcb3-618a-4b89-a97c-d57d28a902fc)

Now, we will also make another changes by creating new Java project in IntelliJ saving it anywhere inside the folder which we set as local repository 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9031679-bade-4fdc-aa73-4f563f8fac59)

The program is simple "Hello world !" printing 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4bacadf-a3e2-478f-9a27-ebce694947ba)

Next, in order to add our code we first need to set our current working dir two levels above where we inicialized the local repository 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cec03a36-4d3f-4af8-9c2e-ebe72a35bfe3)

We commit our changes
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5765c0d0-9d40-4835-b1a9-eee7ce25432b)

And finaly we push everything we commited on the remote git repository
