# Working with Github

GitHub is a website and cloud-based platform where we can store, manage, share code and work together with others by tracking and controlling changes to the code.

## Key fundamentals of GitHub

- **Repositories**: Represents centralized location that stores a collection of files and their revision history for maintaining the versions of development.

- **Branches**: A unique set of code changes with a unique name. When more than one person is working in the project and making changes, in order to encapsulate our changes (like adding a new feature or fixing a bug) we make a new branch.

- **Commits**: Records changes to one or more files in your branch, similar to saving edited file. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, that identifies: the specific change, time of made change and change creator.

- **Pull requests**: Making a pull request is making a proposal to merge changes made in one repository branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch. Before integrating the changes into the main branch the proposed code changes can be reviewed and approved by collaborators.


## Where do we start?

- **Create an account on GitHub**

- **Learn how to post your work on GitHub using the key principles of collaborative working**
  
- **Learn how to download the code for your own use**


## Common "GitHub Flow" Operations

- **Initialize empty repository**: Use `git init`

- **Add changes in our working directory to the staging area**: Use `git add` to add changes in our working directory to staging area where we prepare a snapshot of our projectâ€™s current state before committing it to the repository. It tells Git what updates we want to include to a particular file in the next commit. However, changes are not actually recorded until running git commit.

- **Save the changes - and leave a specific message for the changes done**: `git commit -m `.

- **Define the remote repository**: `git remote add origin [repo-url]` and `git remote set-url origin [repo-url]` before push your code to the master branch of the remote repository defined with "origin" and -u let you point your current local branch to the remote master branch.

- **Upload content from local to remote repositorys**: `git push origin 'branch-name'` to send (or push) the commits from our local branch in our local Git repository to the remote repository. 

- **Download from existing remote repository**: `git clone [repo-url]`


As alternative to GitHub we can also use: Gitlab, Bitbucket, SourceForge and so on, but here we will stick on working with Github.


# Github exercises while working with Java

## Example 1: Upload your first Java project to Github

Following the github flow operations, create your Github repository and create a new simple Java "Hello world" project, which you will upload on the Github repository.

### Solution

**TO DO** STEPS:
- **Create an github account** by entering email, password and username

- **Verify our account** by entering code sent on email. 

- **Login** to our github account

- **Choose create repository** and give the repostory name in following way: "Firstname_Lastname_indexNumber".

- **After creating new repository** we see all commands required to push already existing and new repository (we follow the commands for creating new repository):
```
echo "# Programming-Languages" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "This is my first commit, let's have some fun!"
git remote add origin https://github.com/filkovaivana1/Programming-Languages.git
git push -u origin master
```

- **Create simple "Hello world !" Java project** which after creating should look like:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //TIP Press <shortcut actionId="ShowIntentionActions"/> with your caret at the highlighted text
        // to see how IntelliJ IDEA suggests fixing it.
        System.out.printf("Hello and welcome!");

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            //TIP Press <shortcut actionId="Debug"/> to start debugging your code. We have set one <icon src="AllIcons.Debugger.Db_set_breakpoint"/> breakpoint
            // for you, but you can always add more by pressing <shortcut actionId="ToggleLineBreakpoint"/>.
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

The remaining steps we do this by using command prompt approach. 
- **Open cmd and set our current working directory** to the project directory (or simply open terminal from your project in intelliJ):
```
cd [project_directory]
``` 

- **Initialize empty git repository locally** (if already not done while creating the Java project):
```
git init
```

- **And set the remote origin** to be our remote repository (which means everything we push will go there):
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/filkovaivana1/Programming-Languages.git
```

- **Add our code in the local git repository**:
```
git add .
```

- **Commit our changes** with specific message according to the changes done:
```
git commit -m "This is my first commit, let's have some fun!"
```

- **Finaly push everything we commited on the remote git repository**
```
git push -u origin master
```

*Note: Pushing for the frist time may require some preauthorization

After successful preauthorization we continue pushing our changes and if everything as it should be, we get response message that last operation is done:

## Example 2: Create a MD file
In our newly created repository, create 'README.md' and upload it to your github repository.

### Solution
- **Open cmd and set current working directory** to the project directory (or simply open terminal from your project in intelliJ):
```
cd project_directory
``` 

- **Create md file**:
```
echo "# Programming-Languages" >> README.md
```

- **Add our code in the local git repository**
```
git add .
```

- **Commit our changes**
```
git commit -m "Add README file"
```

- **Push everything commited on the remote git repository**
```
git push -u origin master

```
